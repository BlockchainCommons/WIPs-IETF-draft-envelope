    <abstract>
      <t>The <tt>envelope</tt> protocol specifies a structured format for hierarchical binary data focused on the ability to transmit it in a privacy-focused way. Envelopes are designed to facilitate "smart documents" and have a number of unique features including: easy representation of a variety of semantic structures, a built-in Merkle-like digest tree, deterministic representation using CBOR, and the ability for the holder of a document to selectively encrypt or elide specific parts of a document without invalidating the document structure including the digest tree, or any cryptographic signatures that rely on it.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Gordian Envelope was designed with two key goals in mind: to be <em>Structure-Ready</em>, allowing for the reliable and interopable storage of information; and to be <em>Privacy-Ready</em>, ensuring that transmission of that data can occur in a privacy-protecting manner.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <strong>Structure-Ready.</strong> Gordian Envelope is designed as a Smart Document, meant to store information about a subject. More than that, it's a meta-document that can contain or refer to other documents. It can support multiple data formats, from simple hierarchical structures to labeled property graphs, semantic triples, and other forms of structured graphs. Though its fundamental structure is a tree, it can be used to create Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) through references between Envelopes.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Privacy-Ready.</strong> Gordian Envelope protects the privacy of its data through progressive trust, allowing for holders to minimally disclose information by using elision or encryption, and then to optionally increase that disclosure over time. The fact that a holder can control data revelation, not just an issuer, creates a new level of privacy for all stakeholders. The progressive trust in Gordian Envelopes is accomplished through hashing of all elements, which creates foundational support for cryptographic functions such as signing and encryption, without actually defining which cryptographic functions must be used.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The following architectural decisions support these goals:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <strong>Structured Merkle Tree.</strong> A variant of the Merkle Tree structure is created by forming the hashing of the elements in the Envelope into a tree of digests. (In this "structured Merkele Tree", all nodes contain both semantic content and digests, rather than semantic content being limited to leaves.)</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deterministic Representation.</strong> There is only one way to encode any semantic representation within a Gordian Envelope. This is accomplished through the use of Deterministic CBOR and the sorting of the Envelope by hashes to create a lexicographic order. Any Envelope that doesn't follow these strict rules can be rejected; as a result, there's no need to worry about different people adding the assertions in a different order or at different times: if two Envelopes contain the same data, they will be encoded the same way.</li>
      </ul>
      <section anchor="elision-support">
        <name>Elision Support</name>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <strong>Elision of All Elements.</strong> Gordian Envelopes innately support elision for any part of its data, including subjects, predicates, and objects.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Elision, Compression, and Encryption.</strong> Elision can be used for a variety of purposes including redaction (removing information), compression (removing duplicate information), and encryption (enciphering information).</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Holder-initiated Elision.</strong> Elision can be performed by the Holder of a Gordian Envelope, not just the Issuer.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Granular Holder Control.</strong> Elision can not only be performed by any Holder, but also for any data, allowing each entity to elide data as is appropriate for the management of their personal (or business) risk.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Progressive Trust.</strong> The elision mechanics in Gordian Envelopes allow for progressive trust, where increasing amounts of data are revealed over time, and can be combined with encryption to escrow data to later be revealed.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consistent Hashing.</strong> Even when elided or encrypted, hashes for those parts of the Gordian Envelope remain the same.</li>

            <strong>Herd Privacy.</strong> Proofs of inclusion allow for herd privacy where all members of a class can share data such as a VC or DID without revealing individual information.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Non-Correlation.</strong> Encrypted Gordian Envelope data can optionally be made less correlatable with the addition of salt.</li>

          <li>

            <strong>Multiple Permits.</strong> Gordian Envelopes can simultaneously be locked ("closed") via a variety of means and then openable by any appropriate individual method, with different methods likely held by different people.</li>

            <strong>Cryptography Agnostic.</strong> Generally, the Gordian Envelope architecture is cryptography agnostic, allowing it to work with everything from older algorithms with silicon support through more modern algorithms suited to blockchains and to future zk-proof or quantum-attack resistent cryptographic choices. These choices are made in sets via ciphersuites.</li>

        <t>An envelope is a tagged enumerated type with seven cases. Four of these cases have no children:</t>

            <tt>leaf</tt></li>

        <t>Two of these cases, <tt>encrypted</tt> and <tt>elided</tt> "declare" their digest, i.e., they actually encode their digest in the envelope serialization.

        <t>The other three cases have one or more children:</t>

      <name>Envelope Hierarchy</name>
      <t>This section is informative, and describes envelopes from the perspective of their hierachical structure and the various ways they can be formatted.</t>
      <t>An envelope consists of a <tt>subject</tt> and one or more <tt>predicate-object</tt> pairs called <tt>assertions</tt>:</t>
      <artwork><![CDATA[
subject [
    predicate0: object0
    predicate1: object1
    ...
    predicateN: objectN
]
]]></artwork>
      <t>A concrete example of this might be:</t>
      <artwork><![CDATA[
"Alice" [
    "knows": "Bob"
    "knows": "Carol"
    "knows": "Edward"
]
]]></artwork>
      <t>In the diagram above, there are five distinct "positions" of elements, each of which is itself an envelope and which therefore produces its own digest:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>envelope</li>
        <li>subject</li>
        <li>assertion</li>
        <li>predicate</li>
        <li>object</li>
      </ol>
      <t>The examples above are printed in "envelope notation," which is designed to make the semantic content of envelopes human-readable, but it doesn't show the actual digests associated with each of the positions. To see the structure more completely, we can display every element of the envelope in Tree Notation:</t>
      <artwork><![CDATA[

    27840350 subj "Alice"
    1e0b049b ASSERTION

      <t>For easy recognition, envelope trees and Mermaid diagrams only show the first four bytes of each digest, but internally all digests are 32 bytes.</t>
      <t>From the above envelope and its tree, we make the following observations:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>The envelope is a <tt>node</tt> case, which holds the overall envelope digest.</li>
        <li>The subject "Alice" has its own digest.</li>
        <li>Each of the three assertions have their own digests</li>
        <li>The predicate and object of each assertion each have their own digests.</li>
        <li>The assertions appear in the structure in ascending lexicographic order by digest, which is distinct from envelope notation where they appear sorted alphabeticaly.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The following subsections present each of the seven enumerated envelope cases in five different output formats:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Envelope Notation</li>
        <li>Envelope Tree</li>
        <li>Mermaid</li>
        <li>CBOR Diagnostic Notation</li>
        <li>CBOR hex</li>
      </ul>
      <t>These examples may be used as test vectors. In addition, each subsection starts with the envelope command line <xref target="ENVELOPE-CLI"/> needed to generate the envelope being formatted.</t>

      <name>Known Values</name>
      <t>This section is informative.</t>
      <t>Known values are a specific case of envelope that defines a namespace consisting of single unsigned integers. The expectation is that the most common and widely useful predicates will be assigned in this namespace, but known values may be used in any position in an envelope.</t>
      <t>Most of the examples in this document use UTF-8 strings as predicates, but in real-world applications the same predicate may be used many times in a document and across a body of knowledge. Since the size of an envelope is proportionate to the size of its content, a predicate made using a string like a human-readable sentence or a URL could take up a great deal of space in a typical envelope. Even emplacing the digest of a known structure takes 32 bytes. Known values provide a way to compactly represent predicates and other common values in as few as three bytes.</t>
      <t>Other CBOR tags can be used to define completely separate namespaces if desired, but the reference implementation <xref target="ENVELOPE-REFIMPL"/> and its tools <xref target="ENVELOPE-CLI"/> recognize specific known values and their human-readable names.</t>
      <t>Custom ontologies such as Web Ontology Language <xref target="OWL"/> or Friend of a Friend <xref target="FOAF"/> may someday be represented as ranges of integers in this known space, or be defined in their own namespaces.</t>
      <t>A specification for a standard minimal ontology of known values is TBD.</t>
      <t>The following table lists all the known values currently defined in the reference implementation <xref target="ENVELOPE-REFIMPL"/>. This list is currently informative, but all these known values have been used in the reference implementation for various examples and test vectors.</t>
      <t>Note that a work-in-progress specification for remote procedure calls using envelope has been assigned a namespace starting at 100.</t>

      <t>This section is informative.</t>
      <t>Because each element of an envelope provides a unique digest, and because changing an element in an envelope changes the digest of all elements upwards towards its root, the structure of an envelope is comparable to a <xref target="MERKLE"/>.</t>
      <t>In a Merkle Tree, all semantically significant information is carried by the tree's leaves (for example, the transactions in a block of Bitcoin transactions) while the internal nodes of the tree are nothing but digests computed from combinations of pairs of lower nodes, all the way up to the root of the tree (the "Merkle root".)</t>
      <t>In an envelope, every digest references some semantically significant content: it could reference the subject of the envelope, or one of the assertions in the envelope, or at the predicate or object of a given assertion. Of course, those elements are all envelopes themselves, and thus potentially the root of their own subtree.</t>
      <t>In a merkle tree, the minumum subset of hashes necessary to confirm that a specific leaf node (the "target") must be present is called a "Merkle proof." For envelopes, an analogous proof would be a transformation of the envelope that is entirely elided but preserves the structure necesssary to reveal the target.</t>
      <t>As an example, we produce an envelope representing a simple FOAF <xref target="FOAF"/> style graph:</t>
      <sourcecode type="sh"><![CDATA[
$ ALICE_FRIENDS=`envelope subject Alice |
    envelope assertion knows Bob |
    envelope assertion knows Carol |
    envelope assertion knows Dan`

$ envelope $ALICE_FRIENDS
"Alice" [
    "knows": "Bob"
    "knows": "Carol"
    "knows": "Dan"
]
]]></sourcecode>
      <t>We then elide the entire envelope, leaving only the root-level digest. This digest is a cryptographic commitment to the envelope's contents.</t>
      <sourcecode type="sh"><![CDATA[
$ COMMITMENT=`envelope elide $ALICE_FRIENDS`
$ envelope --tree $COMMITMENT
cd84aa96 ELIDED
]]></sourcecode>
      <t>A third party, having received this commitment, can then request proof that the envelope contains a particular assertion, called the <em>target</em>.</t>
      <sourcecode type="sh"><![CDATA[
$ REQUESTED_ASSERTION=`envelope subject assertion knows Bob`

$ envelope --tree $REQUESTED_ASSERTION
55560bdf ASSERTION
    7092d620 pred "knows"
    9a771715 obj "Bob"
]]></sourcecode>
      <t>The holder can then produce a proof, which is an elided form of the original document that contains a minimum spanning set of digests including the target.</t>
      <sourcecode type="sh"><![CDATA[
$ KNOWS_BOB_DIGEST=`envelope digest $REQUESTED_ASSERTION`

$ KNOWS_BOB_PROOF=`envelope proof create $ALICE_FRIENDS \

      <t>Note that the proof:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>has the same root digest as the commitment,</li>
        <li>includes the digest of the <tt>knows-Bob</tt> assertion: <tt>55560bdf</tt>,</li>
        <li>includes only the other digests necessary to calculate the digest tree from the target back to the root, without revealing any additional information about the envelope.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>Criteria 3 was met when the proof was produced. Critera 1 and 2 are checked by the command line tool when confirming the proof:</t>

      <t>Because envelope is a specification for documents that may persist indefinitely, it is a design goal of this specification that later implementation versions are able to parse envelopes produced by earlier versions. Furthermore, later implementations should be able to compose new envelopes using older envelopes as components.</t>
      <t>The authors considered adding a version number to every envelope, but deemed this unnecessary as any code that parses later envelopes can determine what features are required from the CBOR structure alone.</t>
      <t>The general migration strategy is that the specific structure of envelopes defined in the first general release of this specification is the baseline, and later specifications may incrementally add structural features such as envelope cases, new tags, or support for new structures or algorithms, but are generally expected to maintain backward compatibility.</t>
      <t>An example of addition would be to add an additional supported method of encryption. The <tt>crypto-msg</tt> specification CDDL is a CBOR array with either three or four elements:</t>
      <sourcecode type="cddl"><![CDATA[
crypto-msg = #6.201([ ciphertext, nonce, auth, ? aad ])
ciphertext = bytes       ; encrypted using ChaCha20
aad = digest             ; Additional Authenticated Data
nonce = bytes .size 12   ; Random, generated at encryption-time

      <t>For the sake of this example we assume the new method to be supported has all the same fields, but needs to be processed differently. In this case, the first element of the array could become an optional integer:</t>
      <sourcecode type="cddl"><![CDATA[
crypto-msg = #6.201([ ? version, ciphertext, nonce, auth, ? aad ])
version = uint           ; absent for old method, 1 for new method
]]></sourcecode>
      <t>If present, the first field specifies the later encryption method. If absent, the original encryption method is specified. For low numbered versions, the storage cost of specifying a later version is one byte, and backwards compatibility is preserved.</t>

        <name>Validation Requirements</name>
        <t>Unlike HTML, envelope is intended to be conservative in both what it sends <em>and</em> what it accepts. This means that receivers of envelope-based documents should carefully validate them. Any deviation from the validation requirements of this specification <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> result in the rejection of the entire envelope. Even after validation, envelope contents should be treated with due skepticism.</t>

      <section anchor="signature-considerations">
        <name>Signature Considerations</name>
        <t>This specification allows the signing of envelopes that are partially (or even entirely) elided. There may be use cases for this, such as when multiple users are each signing partially elided envelopes that will then be united. However, it's generally a dangerous practice. Our own tools require overrides to allow it. Other developes should take care to warn users of the dangers of signing elided envelopes.</t>

        <section anchor="choice-of-blake3-hash-primitive">
          <name>Choice of BLAKE3 Hash Primitive</name>
          <t>Although BLAKE2 is more widely supported by IETF specifications, envelope instead makes use of BLAKE3. This is to take advantage of advances in the updated protocol: the new BLAKE3 implementation uses a Merkle Tree format that allows for streaming and for incremental updates as well as high levels of parallelism. The fact that BLAKE3 is newer should be taken into consideration, but its foundation in BLAKE2 and its support by experts such as the Zcash Foundation are considered to grant it sufficient maturity.</t>
          <t>Whereas, envelope is written to allow for the easy exchange of most of its cryptographic protocols, this is not true for BLAKE3: swapping for another hash protocol would result in incompatible envelopes. Thus, any security considerations related to BLAKE3 should be given careful attention.</t>

        <section anchor="well-known-hashes">
          <name>Well-Known Hashes</name>
          <t>Because they are short unsigned integers, well-known values produce well-known digests. Elided envelopes may in some cases inadvertently reveal information by transmitting digests that may be correlated to known information. Envelopes can be salted by adding assertions that contain random data to perturb the digest tree, hence decorrelating it from any known values.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="digest-trees">
          <name>Digest Trees</name>
          <t>Existence proofs include the minimal set of digests that are necessary to calculate the digest tree from the target to the root, but may themselves leak information about the contents of the envelope due to the other digests that must be included in the spanning set. Designers of envelope-based formats should anticipate such attacks and use decorrelation mechanisms like salting where necessary.</t>

        <section anchor="a-tree-not-a-list">
          <name>A Tree, Not a List</name>
          <t>Envelope makes use of a hash tree instead of a hash list to allow this sort of minimal revelation. This decision may also have advantages in scaling. However, there should be further investigation of the limitations of hash trees regarding scaling, particularly for the scaling of large, elided structures.</t>
          <t>There should also be careful consideration of the best practices needed for the creation of deeply nested envelopes, for the usage of subenvelopes created at different times, and for other technical details related to the use of a potentially broad hash tree, as such best practices do not currently exist.</t>

          <name>Salts</name>
          <t>Specifics for the size and usage of salt are not included in this specifications. There are also no requirements for whether salts should be revealed or can be elided. Careful attention may be required for these factors to ensure that they don't accidentally introduce vulnerabilities into usage.</t>
        </section>
        <section anchor="collisions">
          <name>Collisions</name>
          <t>Hash trees tend to make it harder to create collisions than the use of a raw hash function. If attackers manage to find a collision for a hash, they can only replace one node (and its children), so the impact is limited, especially since finding collisions higher in a hash tree grows increasingly difficult because the collision must be a concatenation of multiple hashes. This should generally reduce issues with collisions: finding collisions that fit a hash tree tends to be harder than finding regular collisions. But, the issue always should be considered.</t>

          <name>Leaf-Node Attacks</name>
          <t>Envelope's hash tree  is proof against the leaf-node weakness of Bitcoin that can affect SPVs because its predicates are an unordered set, serialized in increasing lexicographic order by digest, with no possibility for duplication and thus fully deterministic ordering of the tree.</t>

          <t>Envelopes should also be proof against forgery attacks before of their different construction, where all nodes contain both data and hashes. Nonetheless, care must still be taken with trees, especially when also using elision, which limits visible information.</t>

          <t>Support for elision allows for the possibility of contradictory claims where one is kept hidden at any time. So, for example, an evelope could contain contradictory predictions of election results and only reveal the one that matches the actual results. As a result, revealed material should be carefully assessed for this possibility when elided material also exists.</t>

      <name>Appendix: Why CBOR?</name>
      <t>The Concise Binary Object Representation, or CBOR, was chosen as the foundational data structure envelopes for a variety of reasons. These include:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>
          <strong>IETF Standardization.</strong> CBOR is a mature open international IETF standard <xref target="RFC8949"/>.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>IANA Registration.</strong> CBOR is further standardized by the registration of common data type tags through IANA <xref target="IANA-CBOR-TAGS"/>.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fully Extensible.</strong> Beyond that, CBOR is entirely extensible with any data types desired, such as our own listing of UR tags <xref target="BC-UR-TAGS"/>.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-describing Descriptions.</strong> CBOR-encoded data is self-describing, so there are no requirements for pre-defined schemas nor more complex descriptions such as those found in ASN.1 <xref target="ASN-1"/>.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Constraint Friendly.</strong> CBOR is built to be frugal with CPU and memory, so it works well in constrained environments such as on cryptographic silicon chips.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unambiguous Encoding.</strong> Our use of Deterministic CBOR, combined with our own specification rules, such as the sorting of Envelopes by hash, results in a singular, unambiguous encoding.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multiple Implementations.</strong> Implementation are available in a variety of languages <xref target="CBOR-IMPLS"/>.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compact Implementations.</strong> Compactness of encoding and decoding is one of CBOR's core goals; implementations are built on headers or snippets of code, and do not require any external tools.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>Also see a comparison to Protocol Buffers <xref target="UR-QA"/>, a comparison to Flatbuffers <xref target="CBOR-FLATBUFFERS"/>, and a comparison to other binary formats <xref target="CBOR-FORMAT-COMPARISON"/>.</t>
