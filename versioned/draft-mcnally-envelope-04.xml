<t>Gordian Envelope specifies a structured format for hierarchical binary data focused on the ability to transmit it in a privacy-focused way, offering support for privacy as described in RFC 6973 and human rights as described in RFC 8280. Envelopes are designed to facilitate "smart documents" and have a number of unique features including: easy representation of a variety of semantic structures, a built-in Merkle-like digest tree, deterministic representation using CBOR, and the ability for the holder of a document to selectively elide specific parts of a document without invalidating the digest tree structure. This document specifies the base Envelope format, which is designed to be extensible.</t>

<section anchor="introduction">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>Gordian Envelope was designed with two key goals in mind: to be <em>Structure-Ready</em>, allowing for the reliable and interoperable encoding and storage of information; and to be <em>Privacy-Ready</em>, ensuring that transmission of that data can occur in a privacy-protecting manner.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <strong>Structure-Ready.</strong> Gordian Envelope is designed as a "smart document": a set of information about a subject. More than that, it's a meta-document that can contain or refer to other documents. It can support multiple data structures, from single data items, to simple hierarchies, to labeled property graphs, semantic triples, and other forms of structured graphs. Though its fundamental structure is a tree, it can be used to create Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) through references within or between Envelopes.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Privacy-Ready.</strong> Gordian Envelope protects privacy by affording progressive trust, allowing for holders (not just issuers) to minimally disclose information by using elision, and then to optionally increase that disclosure over time. Progressive trust in Gordian Envelopes is accomplished through the hashing of all elements, which also creates foundational support for signing and encryption. This directly addresses the data minimization suggested by "Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols" <xref target="RFC6973"/> and also addresses topics such as Privacy, Accessibility, Censorship Resistance, Reliability, and Integrity, which are listed as guidelines in "Research into Human Rights Protocol Considerations" <xref target="RFC8280"/>.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The following architectural decisions support these goals:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <strong>Structured Merkle Tree.</strong> A variant of the Merkle Tree <xref target="MERKLE"/> structure is created by hashing the elements in the Envelope into a tree of digests. (In this "structured Merkle Tree", all nodes contain both semantic content and digests, rather than semantic content being limited to leaves.)</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deterministic Representation.</strong> There is only one way to encode any semantic representation within a Gordian Envelope. This is accomplished through the use of Deterministic CBOR <xref target="DCBOR"/> and the sorting of the Envelope's assertions into a lexicographic order (not to be confused with sorting a CBOR encoding's map keys). Any Envelope that doesn't follow these strict rules will be rejected; as a result, separate actors assembling envelopes from the same information will converge on the same encoded structure.</li>
      </ul>
      <section anchor="elision-support">
        <name>Elision Support</name>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>
            <strong>Holder-initiated Elision.</strong> Elision can be performed by the Holder of a Gordian Envelope, not just the Issuer.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Granular Elision.</strong> Elision can be performed on any data within an Envelope including subjects, predicates and objects of assertions, assertions as a whole, and envelopes as a whole. This allows each entity to elide data as is appropriate for the management of their personal or business risk.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Progressive Trust.</strong> The elision mechanics in Gordian Envelopes allow for progressive trust, where increasing amounts of data may be revealed over time.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consistent Hashing.</strong> Even when elided, digests for those parts of the Gordian Envelope remain the same. So constructs such as signatures remain verifiable even for elided documents.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reversible Elision.</strong> Elision can be reversed by the Holder of a Gordian Envelope, which means removed information can be selectively replaced without changing the digest tree.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section anchor="extensions">
        <name>Extensions</name>
        <t>This document is the base specification for Gordian Envelope, which is stable and useful by itself. However it is also designed to support optional extensions, to be specified in separate documents.</t>
        <t>A few such extensions may require adding new Envelope cases: these will extend the Envelope format itself, and will therefore need to be supported by Envelope encoders. Examples include symmetric encryption and compression which (like elision) allow for the transformation of Envelope elements without changing the digest tree.</t>
        <t>However, most extensions will be specified by defining the semantics of new subjects, predicates, and objects. Such extensions do not require extending the Envelope format but may be supported by tools. Examples include signatures, public-key encryption, digest decorrelation, intra- and inter-Envelope references using digests, expression evaluation and distributed function calls, diffing and merging envelopes, and inclusion proofs.</t>
        <t>Building on this base specification, we expect a robust ecosystem of extensions to emerge, facilitating a wide variety of applications.</t>

      <name>Envelope Format Specification</name>
      <t>This section is normative and specifies the Gordian Envelope binary format in terms of its CBOR components and their sequencing. The formal language used is the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) <xref target="RFC8610"/>. To be considered a well-formed Envelope, a sequence of bytes <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> conform to the Gordian dCBOR deterministic CBOR profile <xref target="DCBOR"/> and <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> conform to the specifications in this section.</t>
      <t>An Envelope is a tagged enumerated type with five cases. Here is the entire CDDL specification for the base Envelope format. Each case is discussed in detail below:</t>
      <sourcecode type="cddl"><![CDATA[
envelope = #6.200(envelope-content)
envelope-content = (
    leaf /
    elided /
    node /
    assertion /
    wrapped
)

leaf = #6.24(bytes .dcbor any)

elided = sha256-digest
sha256-digest = bytes .size 32

node = [subject, + assertion-element]
subject = envelope-content
assertion-element = ( assertion / elided-assertion )
elided-assertion = elided           ; MUST represent an assertion.

assertion = { predicate: object }
predicate = envelope-content
object = envelope-content

wrapped = envelope
]]></sourcecode>
      <t>Some of these cases create a hierarchical, recursive structure by including children that are themselves Envelopes. Two of these cases (<tt>leaf</tt> and <tt>elided</tt>) have no children. The <tt>node</tt> case adds one or more assertions to the envelope, each of which is a child. The <tt>assertion</tt> case is a predicate/object pair, both of which are children. The <tt>wrapped</tt> case is used to wrap an entire Envelope including its assertions (its child), so that assertions can be made about the wrapped Envelope as a whole.</t>
      <section anchor="leaf-case-format">
        <name>Leaf Case Format</name>
        <t>A <tt>leaf</tt> case is used when the Envelope contains only user-defined CBOR content. It is tagged using <tt>#6.24</tt>, per <xref target="RFC8949"/> §3.4.5.1, "Encoded CBOR Data Item". See §4 of <xref target="CCDE"/> for CDDL support for dCBOR.</t>
        <sourcecode type="cddl"><![CDATA[

        <t>The <tt>leaf</tt> case can be discriminated from other Envelope case arms by the fact that it is the only one that is tagged using <tt>#6.24</tt>.</t>
        <t>To preserve deterministic encoding, authors of application-level data formats based on Envelope <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only encode CBOR that conforms to dCBOR <xref target="DCBOR"/> in the <tt>leaf</tt> case. Care must be taken to ensure that leaf dCBOR follows best practices for deterministic encoding, such as clearly specifying when tags for nested structures <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> or <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used.</t>

        <t>The <tt>elided</tt> case can be discriminated from other Envelope case arms by the fact that it is the only one that is a CBOR byte string and always has a length of 32 bytes.</t>
        <t>If the method of producing the digest ever changes, the top-level Envelope tag <tt>#6.200</tt> <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be changed to a new value, and the new method <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be specified in a new document. This is to ensure that the digest tree remains consistent.</t>

        <t>A <tt>node</tt> case is encoded as a CBOR array. A <tt>node</tt> case <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used when one or more assertions are present on the Envelope. A <tt>node</tt> case <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be present when there is not at least one assertion.</t>
        <t>The first element of the array is the Envelope's <tt>subject</tt>, followed by one or more <tt>assertion-element</tt>s, each of which <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> either be an <tt>assertion</tt> or an <tt>elided-assertion</tt>.</t>

    <section anchor="envelope-hierarchy">
      <name>Envelope Hierarchy</name>
      <t>This section is informative, and describes Envelopes from the perspective of their hierarchical structure and the various ways they can be formatted.</t>
      <t>Notionally an Envelope can be thought of as a <tt>subject</tt> and one or more <tt>predicate-object</tt> pairs called <tt>assertions</tt>.</t>
      <t>Note that the following example is <em>not</em> CDDL or CBOR diagnostic notation, but "Envelope notation," which is a convenient way to describe the structure of an Envelope:</t>
      <artwork><![CDATA[
subject [
    predicate0: object0
    predicate1: object1
    ...
    predicateN: objectN
]
]]></artwork>
      <t>A concrete example of this might be:</t>
      <artwork><![CDATA[
"Alice" [
    "knows": "Bob"
    "knows": "Carol"
    "knows": "Edward"
]
]]></artwork>
      <t>The notional concept of Envelope is helpful, but not technically accurate because Envelope is implemented structurally as an enumerated type consisting of five cases. This allows actual Envelope instances to be more flexible, for example a "bare assertion" consisting of a predicate-object pair with no subject, which is useful in some situations:</t>
      <artwork><![CDATA[
"knows": "Bob"
]]></artwork>
      <t>More common is the opposite case: a subject with no assertions:</t>
      <artwork><![CDATA[
"Alice"
]]></artwork>
      <t>In Envelopes, there are five distinct "positions" of elements, each of which is itself an Envelope and which therefore produces its own digest:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>envelope</li>
        <li>subject</li>
        <li>assertion</li>
        <li>predicate</li>
        <li>object</li>
      </ol>
      <t>The examples above are printed in Envelope notation, which is designed to make the semantic content of Envelopes human-readable, but it doesn't show the actual digests associated with each of the positions. To see the structure more completely, we can display every element of the Envelope in "Tree Format":</t>
      <artwork><![CDATA[
6255e3b6 NODE
    13941b48 subj "Alice"
    4012caf2 ASSERTION
        db7dd21c pred "knows"
        afb8122e obj "Carol"
    65c3ebc3 ASSERTION
        db7dd21c pred "knows"
        e9af7883 obj "Edward"
    78d666eb ASSERTION
        db7dd21c pred "knows"
        13b74194 obj "Bob"
]]></artwork>
      <t>For easy recognition, Envelope trees only show the first four bytes of each digest, but internally all digests are 32 bytes.</t>
      <t>From the above Envelope and its tree, we make the following observations:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>The Envelope is a <tt>node</tt> case, which has the overall Envelope digest.</li>
        <li>The subject "Alice" has its own digest.</li>
        <li>Each of the three assertions have their own digests</li>
        <li>The predicate and object of each assertion each have their own digests.</li>
        <li>The assertions appear in the structure in ascending lexicographic order by digest, which is the actual order in which they are serialized, and which is distinct from Envelope notation, where they appear sorted alphabetically.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>The following subsections present each of the five enumerated Envelope cases in four different output formats:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Envelope Notation</li>
        <li>Envelope Tree</li>
        <li>CBOR Diagnostic Notation</li>
        <li>CBOR hex</li>
      </ul>
      <t>These examples may be used as test vectors. In addition, each subsection starts with the <tt>envelope</tt> command line <xref target="ENVELOPE-CLI"/> needed to generate the Envelope being formatted.</t>

              <t>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack.</t>
              <t>This document obsoletes RFC 7049, providing editorial improvements, new details, and errata fixes while keeping full compatibility with the interchange format of RFC 7049. It does not create a new version of the format.</t>
